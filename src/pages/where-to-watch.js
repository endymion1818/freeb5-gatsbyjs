    Babylon 5 isn&#8217;t on the air that often these days, so you might want to check out [Amazon Video][1], [iTunes][2] or other suppliers in your country. We&#8217;re campaigning for [Netflix to add Babylon 5][3] to their catalogue, so [please request it now!][4]

    ## United States

    In April 2017 we heard that [Go90][5] streaming service from Verizon will stream Babylon 5 as part of a deal with Warner Bros.

    [US TV channel Comet TV has been showing The Lost Tales][6] as well. Please tell us if this is still happening.

    ## International

    TV stations in New Zealand and Germany have recently aired all 5 seasons. Please [let us know][7] if you hear of anywhere else that&#8217;s showing the series!

    ## Let us know!

    [Keep a check on this category in the Newsroom (&#8220;Where to Watch Babylon5&#8221;)][8], we&#8217;ll try to keep you updated when we hear of airings. In the meantime, [keep in touch via our Facebook page][9], as it&#8217;s likely that announcements will be made there first!
