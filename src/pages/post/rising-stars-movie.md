In typical JMS fashion, this post appeared on the &#8220;Fans of J. Michael Straczynski&#8221; Facebook group at the beginning of June:



Naturally, fans of Babylon 5 were seriously hoping this would be an announcement relating to the long-awaited reboot of Babylon 5, however, about a week later, the news broke that MGM has optioned to make a movie out of &#8220;Rising Stars&#8221;, a comic series written by JMS staring in 1999.

I think this is the first JMS-created property to get a movie release, if all goes well with the production, unless I&#8217;m mistaken?
