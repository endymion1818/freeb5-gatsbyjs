http://www.comettv.com/…/17…/Science+fiction/MV002026280000/ If you don&#8217;t have it on your cable, you can watch it online. Maybe if a lot us us contacted them to ask for the series it might get a response? I&#8217;ve already done so! Use this link to send them a message: http://www.comettv.com/about-comet-tv/
