Banners are going up in San Diego for Comic-Con and ‪#‎FreeBabylon5‬ will be there with a panel!

  1. Lots of interest in the Ambassadorial Kits on Ebay. I&#8217;ll be able to list \*seven\* more of them that will include the keyrings. Stay tuned or watch seller name freebabylon5
  2. Fundraising is holding at 60% of our $1500 goal, even with matching funds. The more we raise, the more people we&#8217;ll be able to reach. Paypal donations to email address freebabylon5@aol.com or send email there if you have any questions. https://www.paypal.com/ Thanks!
