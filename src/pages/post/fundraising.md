The time has come&#8230;We&#8217;ve had time to bask in the victory of WATCH TV showing B5 in reruns. Our website is up and beautiful.

Soon we&#8217;ll be in the midst of the Thunderclap campaign. But now&#8230;it&#8217;s time for fundraising. Despite all of the fabulous volunteer labor (Take a bow, Ranger Ben Read), raising awareness of B5 and getting it in front of people has and will take money.

So please, click on the &#8216;Donate&#8217; button on the FreeBabylon5.com website if you can. And thank you if you already have! Thanks All!! ~Jan
