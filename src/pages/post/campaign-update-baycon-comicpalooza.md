Thanks to Ranger Jon and Ranger Phil for distributing #FreeBabylon5 goodies at BayCon and Comicpalooza recently! Word is that folks are happy to get it! Welcome aboard any new folks!

Next up I think is Fedcon in Germany. Remember, if you&#8217;ll be attending any cons, I&#8217;ll be happy to mail you things to hand out or leave on freebie tables.
