It&#8217;s been very quiet on the Movie News front for the first half of 2016, but recently in an interview with Awards Daily, show creator JMS has indicated that his plans for a feature movie that would reboot the series, is still planned for some time in the near future.

How near?

Well, if you don&#8217;t know the answer to that, I don&#8217;t either.

[Here&#8217;s the article,][1] which also has a lot of information about Sense8 season 2, and some interesting background about why we won&#8217;t be getting a new Babylon 5 TV series any time soon.
