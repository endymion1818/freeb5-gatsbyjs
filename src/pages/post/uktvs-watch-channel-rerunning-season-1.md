UKTV&#8217;s [Watch][1] faithfully re-ran the whole of Babylon 5, including &#8220;The Lost Tales&#8221;, and finished last week.

But &#8230; the channel is starting a re-run straight away, weekdays at 5pm.

It might be a good opportunity to mention this to newbies or others who might be interested in catching the show for the first time. #FreeBabylon5!

The reruns started on Monday, 24th April. Next episode is tonight at 5pm, S1E2, &#8216;Soul Hunter&#8217;.
