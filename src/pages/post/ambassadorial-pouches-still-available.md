Still Ambassadorial Pouches available where you choose the color you prefer for the Army of Light dog tag. Choices are Space Black, Station Blue, Mars Red, Gold Channel, Drazi Green or Centauri Purple. There may be more available after the #FreeBabylon5 excursion to Comic-Con but this is the last listing until then.
