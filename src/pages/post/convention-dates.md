We&#8217;ve received information about a comprehensive list of conventions in the UK on the website of UK sci-fi fan group The League of the Non-Aligned.

You can find the list here:

If you&#8217;re a Ranger based in the UK and are planning to attend any of these events please let us know. There may be something we can do to help you support the #FreeBabylon5 campaign.

**Not in the UK?** Please find out where there are conventions near you, and let us know so we can add it to the board&#8230; thanks!
