Another long-time fan (a first one) who is very enthusiastic about Babylon5 is Tim. He has watched the show from quite a young age, so he has been a fan for most of his life! And without any further ado, I present his Fan interview!

&nbsp;

So, a little bit about me. Hi, I&#8217;m Tim, I&#8217;m 29Â and I am something of a sci-fi junkie. Babylon 5 was my first foray into science-fiction and everything just kind of snow-balled from there. I love watching any of the Trek, Stargate, Farscape, BattlestarGalactica&#8230; you name it, chances are I like it. But however many additional shows get added to the list, I always wind up back with Babylon 5.Â Of late, I have also enjoyed discussing my sci-fi love with lots of other like-minded folks on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/parks8472" target="_blank">@parks8472</a>) Most recently I have posted pics and quotes from every episode of B5 (starting with The Gathering and culminating with Sleeping in Light) It was fun, although took some work to include a decent quote, the episode titles (some of them are ridiculously long LOL)Â and #FreeBabylon5 all in 140 characters.

ANA: I loved your quote pictures! Good job! When did you first watch Babylon 5 and how many times have you watched it since!

TIM: I started watching Babylon 5 when Season 3 first aired in the UK in 1996. It started a month or so after my Dad passed away and I was (atÂ age 10)Â slightly adrift without any kind of male role model. Anyway, I digress; one weekend we had visitors for the weekend and Sunday evening rolled around and one of them asked if could watch something on the TV; that something, of course, turned out to be &#8216;Matters of Honor&#8217; I stuck around to watch it, not so much out of interest but because I was kind of lonelyÂ and I was hooked by the end of the opening credits. From there, every Sunday for the next few months became Babylon 5 night and I got more and more engrossed with each episode. I started to get caught up with the first two seasons on VHSÂ in the week between parts 1 and 2 of &#8216;War Without End&#8217; I would love to be able to tell you how many times I have watched it the intervening 18 years&#8230; but I have lost count.

ANA: So very many rewatches, I take it! Do you have any favourite characters?

TIM: Favourite characters: Michael Garibaldi- Garibaldi is one of my favourite characters because he is the everyman, he&#8217;s not a career officer, he&#8217;s not a diplomat; he&#8217;s a just a guy trying to get through the day. While all of the human characters are relatable, Garibaldi is easily the most like us; he doesn&#8217;t have all the answers, he doesn&#8217;t pretend to completely understand the monumental situations that he finds himself a part of. Quick with a joke or a sarcastic comment, he is the voice of the audience; we understand as he understands. He&#8217;s a man with demons, but a good man nevertheless.

G&#8217;Kar- G&#8217;Kar is my favourite of the alien characters, partly because Andreas Katsulas was a phenomenal actor and gave his character such amazing presence. Couple that with possibly the best character arc of any of the characters and G&#8217;Kar is, in my opinion, one of the best aliens in science fiction. His character goes through the must dramatic changes; starting off as the closest thing the show had to a bad-guy (of sorts) to become one it&#8217;s strongest and greatest figureheads. He has everything taken away from him; he loses his title, his world, even his purpose. But he makes a new path for himself.

That&#8217;s just a quick glimpse of a couple of my favourite characters, I could go on at length about all of them.

ANA: Babylon 5 is a show with many strong characters to be sure! Have you learned any life lessons from the show?

TIM: Have I learned any life-lessons from watching B5? Yeah actually;Â when faced with the question &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; run for the hills. Apart from that, no probably not ðŸ™‚

ANA: Tim, what do you want? Nah, you donâ€™t have to answer that â€“ are there any particular themes that stand out for you?

TIM: Â I guess my favourite theme in the series is the idea that change/progress isn&#8217;t just down to governments or organisations, that one person can make a difference in the world. I love the idea that the individual can play a role; either by being in the right place at the right time, or having the right idea.

I also like the theme that runs through Londo&#8217;s arc; that of &#8216;be careful what you wish you&#8217; One simple (hah) request or dream can spiral so totally out of control, all because we don&#8217;t always think about what we are asking for or how what we asking for could be achieved or what it will mean for those around us. It&#8217;s a good reminder that just becauseÂ WE want something, it doesn&#8217;t mean that it is a good thing or that what we want is good for everyone else.

ANA: Londo has an amazing arc! Are there any particular aspects of the show that speak to you personally?

TIM: I suppose the biggest aspect that speaks to me personally is the idea that the right thing to do IS the right thing to do; regardless of whether it will be a popular decision, regardless of what others will do or say about you, regardless of whether you make the standÂ surround by supporters or totally alone (heh, very nearly quoted the show there, but I reined it back)Â Even if it involves a degree of short-term discomfort or problems,Â the right thing to do is always the right thing to do.

ANA: Quoting the show is good, no reining back necessary! Have you recommended Babylon 5 to anyone? Would you do so again?

TIM: Honestly, I&#8217;ve lost track of the number of people that I&#8217;ve recommendedÂ Babylon 5 to over the years. If you&#8217;re into science-fiction, it&#8217;s a show that I think HAS to be watched.

ANA: I hope you persuaded some to watch! What do you think about the #FreeBabylon5 campaign?

TIM: I think the #FreeBabylon5 campaign is a fantastic idea, spreading awareness about my favourite of favourite shows is awesome. It&#8217;s always struck me as odd that it&#8217;s never achieved the instant recognition that something like Star Trek has. I fully support the #FreeBabylon5 campaign and its goal to keep a most amazing show alive&#8230; Faith Manages.

Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing if more young people had the opportunity to grow up with Babylon 5 in their lives as Tim did? Â This is yet another huge reason to continue our letter writing campaigns and pushing to get Babylon 5 back on the air. #FreeBabylon5
