Are you going to be going to the Space City Con (<http://spacecitycon.com/> ) in Galveston, TX Jan. 3-5? It&#8217;s only 33 days away and there are only a couple more days of discounted advance tickets. There will be \*\\*\*18\*\** Babylon 5 actors there! The convention has graciously donated a table to #FreeBabylon5 and I&#8217;ve just received the banner we&#8217;ll be displaying. Thanks to the wonderful Ranger Reverend for the design!
