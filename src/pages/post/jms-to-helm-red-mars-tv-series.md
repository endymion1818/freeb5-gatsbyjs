So I&#8217;m a bit behind posting this, having been on an extended hiatus from the #FreeBabylon5 campaign (sorry to regulars who have missed these updates!):

SpikeTV has announced that JMS is to be not just writer, but as Executive Producer on the series as well. As you may remember, Straczynski was executive producer on Babylon 5 too, mainly so &#8220;nobody could change [his] lines&#8221; &#8230; but it also made it possible for the show to come from one creative vision, in a way that Star Wars did through George Lucas.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re as excited as I am to see what Joe will do with this exciting source material.

Where does this put the [potential Babylon 5 reboot][1]? You tell me.
