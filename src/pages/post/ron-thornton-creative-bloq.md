Ron Thornton was the visual effects designer on Babylon 5 in seasons 1-3. He has also worked on other popular TV shows and feature films including Start Trek, Starship Troopers, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Crazies and Spaceballs.

This interview on UK&#8217;s Future Publishing site Creative Bloq is a fascinating insight into how Ron and concept artist Steve Burg came up with some of the iconic designs in Babylon 5:

(As an aside, I didn&#8217;t know that Steve Burg also designed The Prometheus for Ridley Scott&#8217;s movie).
