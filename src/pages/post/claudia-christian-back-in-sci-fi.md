Barnes & Noble have just announced Claudia Christian&#8217;s first foray into SF writing with her debut novel &#8220;Wolf&#8217;s Empire: Gladiator&#8221;. Below is B&N&#8217;s introduction to the planned series:

&#8220;In this alternate far-future world, the Roman Empire never fell, and over the millennia, it has expanded its borders beyond Earth and out into the depths of the galaxy.&#8221;

The writeup, by a long time Babylon 5 fan, is very complimentary of the TV series we love so much, and shares some insights into the world building that went into the Wolf&#8217;s Empire series.

You can read the writeup [here][1].
