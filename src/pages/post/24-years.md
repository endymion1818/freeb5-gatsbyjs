Now I feel old &#8230;

The pilot episode of Babylon 5, called &#8220;The Gathering&#8221;, aired 24 years ago on 22nd February. If I tell you what year that was, you might be able to work out my age or something, so I&#8217;ll hold my tongue.

Do you remember what you thought of that first episode when it aired? Did you see that first episode, or, like me, did you start watching when the series started with &#8220;Midnight on the Firing Line&#8221;, or at some point after that?

A good place to discuss your memories with other fans would be [our Facebook page][1], which now has 7,045 likes, about half of which prefer the Green Drazi party, the other half prefer Purple.

Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.

Pat Tallman has been sharing her memories of the show on her facebook page, here&#8217;s the video:
