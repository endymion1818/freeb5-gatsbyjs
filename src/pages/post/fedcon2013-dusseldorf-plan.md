**-Saturday May 31st at 6 : 15 pm.** Flashmob (spontaneous gathering of people in a specific time and a specific place, with people doing the same movements for few minutes)

The Place : Meeting point in front of Classico Restaurant (if it&#8217;s rainy : the Flashmob will take place there. If it&#8217;s sunny : Flashmob will take place outside the hotel, exit left to Classico restaurant).

**Other information :** If you want to come with your Babylon 5 costumes, it&#8217;s highly recommanded !
