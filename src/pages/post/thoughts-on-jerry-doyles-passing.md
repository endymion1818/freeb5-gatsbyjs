It&#8217;s with great sadness that we report that Jerry Doyle has passed away at the age of 60. A great actor, and a really strong character in real life as in the show, Jerry will be sadly missed.

Joe Straczynski has posted an article on the news site Jerry founded, Epic Times, to share his thoughts:

&#8220;He was funny, and dangerous, and loyal, and a prankster, and a pain in the ass; he was gentle and cynical and hardened and insightful&#8221; — JMS

Patricia Tallman posted a Facebook Live video to share her feelings, but also asked that we as fans take a step back and show respect whilst cast & crew and friends deal with their loss:



What a sad day for all of us.

Goodbye, old friend.
