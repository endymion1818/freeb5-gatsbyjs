Ranger Jenny&#8217;s given us a sneak peek at the first of the #FreeBabylon5 tees that will be available at Space City Con Jan. 3-5. Stay tuned to be able to pre-order so you&#8217;ll be sure to get the size you want!

ETA: Forgot to mention &#8211; all profits from the sale of these shirts will go to benefit Claudia Christian&#8217;s C3 Foundation to spread the word about the Sinclair Method of alcoholism treatment.
