Finding it hard to write this. Another great founding father of Babylon 5 has passed away today. I&#8217;m reposting this from the [gofundme.com page][1]:

&#8220;I am grieved to tell you that Ron Thornton has passed away this evening. Ron has meant so much to so many of us over the years; he is indeed a VFX legend but he was also an incredible human being, a true friend, a great mentor to so many, and just so alive. He relished life and came at it with so much energy and creativity and openness, at work and at play. He will be so missed, by so many, but most especially by his beloved wife, Lada. In keeping with your own spirit, please send your thoughts and prayers for strength and comfort her way.

&#8220;I thank everyone for their contributions to this fund. It is still open for the expenses and assistance that Lada needs at this time of loss.&#8221;

[The gofundme page is still accepting donations towards expenses and supporting Lada.][1]

I haven&#8217;t been posting much because I wanted to share some good news with you first, despite the amount of sad news that&#8217;s come on us recently. Pat Tallman posted on her blog that makeup artist John Vulich also passed away in November:



This is once again a cause of great sadness to the industry and especially to the Babylon 5 community. Both Ron and John were inspirational people who really brought the show alive. They will be missed greatly.
