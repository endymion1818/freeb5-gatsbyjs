TV news and listings website &#8220;Zap2It&#8221;, a fresh and lively guide for millions of Americans who love TV and movies, has interviewed creator JMS on the anniversary of 20 years of Babylon 5.

The interview reflects on the shows&#8217; lasting legacy, including how open JMS was about the process of creating Babylon 5 and the constant dialog that was going on between fans and himself during the shows run. &#8220;my thought at the time was that viewers can&#8217;t get what they want without understanding the process.&#8221;
