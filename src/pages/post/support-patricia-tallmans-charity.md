If you&#8217;re like me, you like knowing exactly where your hard-earned money is going. I&#8217;ve been supporting the Penny Lane effort via Patricia Tallman for several years now. This is an effort to give kids so horribly abused that they cannot be placed in foster homes a Christmas that lets them know that there are caring people in the world. Please give if you can and share as far and wide as possible. Thanks!
