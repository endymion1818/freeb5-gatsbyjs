Aaannd San Diego Comic-Con is over. I handed out about 1,000 posttcards and 800 buttons and 250 badge ribbons and 150 letters to be sent by fans and 50 lanyards and lots of temporary tattoos and a bunch of the Perspective magazine that the Art Direcot&#8217;s Guild allowed us to pass out for free.

It was a rewarding con even without the announcement of the future feature film because I got to talk to so many people. But if I never say &#8220;Babylon 5 hasn&#8217;t been on TV in the US for over ten years&#8221; again, it&#8217;ll be too soon. I&#8217;m actually a little bit hoarse.

[Here&#8217;s a roundup on ComicsBeat of the announcements at Comic Con][1]

And lastly, a photo of JMS accepting a #FreeBabylon5 button at #SDCC.
