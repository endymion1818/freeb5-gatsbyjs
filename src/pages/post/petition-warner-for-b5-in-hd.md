Fellow lurker Jay Fubler Harvey has started a campaign on change.org since we found out that Warner Brothers probably have the master negatives in storage somewhere.

A recent tweet by series creator J Michael Straczynski states:

_"But at the end of each season we were required to transfer all digital assets direct to film, frame by frame, so Warners could have a version that could be used across all later formats. That version, with pristine CG and live action, has never seen the light of day."_
