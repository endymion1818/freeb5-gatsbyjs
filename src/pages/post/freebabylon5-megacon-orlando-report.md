Megacon was held in Orlando a week ago and some intrepid volunteers handed out buttons and made sure that the freebie tables had a supply of buttons and postcards. Do you have a convention near you soon? Can you hand out some buttons and postcards to spread the word about the #FreeBabylon5 campaign? Message me here and I&#8217;ll get a package off to you! Thanks!

PS: Those of you who&#8217;ve gotten packages, we&#8217;d love to share pics of you and fellow fans.
