Hi folks! There&#8217;s been a lot of interest in the Ambassadorial Pouches and as I mentioned the other day, I&#8217;m about to do a few more auctions. (I&#8217;m posting this early to reach the most people possible).

Two notes:

A) these are the \*last\* pouches that will feature the carabiner keyring as I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be ordering them again and

B) all 9 of these auctions will feature the brand new dog tag color I got for Comic-Con, Gold Channel gold.

I&#8217;m going to time the auctions to start Friday at 10AM Eastern time so watch this Ebay link (nothing there yet) because there are fewer than ten of these:

PS. Proceeds from these \*will\* count for matching funds! Woo-Hoo!
