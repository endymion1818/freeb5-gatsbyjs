Convention Season&#8217;s in full swing! Many thanks to everybody who&#8217;s handed out #FreeBabylon5 buttons and postcards at conventions.

#FreeBabylon5 will be going to San Diego Comic-Con in July and we&#8217;re hoping to really make an appearance! I&#8217;m on a waiting list for a Fan Table and I&#8217;ve applied to have a Free Babylon 5 panel during the con. SDCC also has huge freebie tables and \*IF\* I get a panel or table, I&#8217;ll be able to place handouts on those. Otherwise not. So whatever you usually do to attract luck, would you do it now?
