Good news/bad news today. The good news is that we&#8217;ve reached 24% our our fundraising goal! AND I may have some even better news later in the week. Know that any donation, large or small is welcome and put to good use.

Bad news&#8230;though pretty much expected, San Diego Comic-Con released its list of Fan Tables and #FreeBabylon5 wasn&#8217;t on it. We were on a waiting list so we knew that chances were slim unless there was a cancellation. Congratulations to those who got the space!
