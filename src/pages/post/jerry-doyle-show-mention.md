Jerry Doyle, who starred as Michael Garibaldi and was Babylon 5&#8217;s longest regular cast member, interviewed fellow B5 actor & director Stephen Furst (who played Londo&#8217;s diplomatic aid Vir Cotto) on his podcast radio show &#8216;The Jerry Doyle Show&#8217; on Sunday night.

&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t miss the conversation with and Stephen Furst. We broke news on the #FreeBabylon5 question&#8230;.&#8221; Doyle reported, although it actually seems like no news is good news:

&#8220;@FreeBabylon5 Did you know that neither of us had been contacted about a revamp of the show? No? That&#8217;s news. Just not the news we wanted.&#8221;, Jerry responded on Twitter, to a claim that nothing was said about Babylon 5 other than the two actors haven&#8217;t been contacted to reprise their roles.

Does that mean they know something&#8217;s up and they&#8217;re not allowed to talk about it? Was it just a red herring?

Whatever you might believe, it certainly was good to hear them talk about Babylon 5 and the campaign. It&#8217;s great to hear our voice is growing stronger all the time.
