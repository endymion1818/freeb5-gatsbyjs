2 days ago, Jason Davis, writer, editor for Harlan Ellison and Babylon 5 historian, launched a Kickstarter campaign "Preserve the history of BABYLON 5 using archival paperwork and interviews with cast and crew to create a definitive making-of book."

Twitter account @B5News has been promoting this project, and I'm really hoping you can back it too:
