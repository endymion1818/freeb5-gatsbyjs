We would like to congratulate French blogger and Babylon 5 fan [@ripleyaeryn_][1] for helping to kick-start the #FreeBabylon5 campaign in France!

&#8220;After a global version of #FreeBabylon5 (which I didn&#8217;t launch), I decided it was time for French version to come in.&#8221; she comments on her blog, <http://freebabylon5fr.blogspot.fr>.

@ripleyaeryn_ states the campaign goals are: &#8220;Getting Babylon 5 aired in France on France 4 or Arte.&#8221; and to &#8220;Inform and support the other countries.&#8221;

@ripleyaeryn_&#8217;s blog informs us that there has already been a recent article on international French newspaper &#8220;Le Monde&#8221;&#8216;s website which remembers fondly a dawn of a golden age of TV series.

If you are a viewer in France, or a French-speaking country, please visit the blog and see what you could do to help @ripleyaeryn_ get Babylon 5 back on French TV.

Great work @ripleyaeryn_, please keep us up-to-date with the latest campaign news from France!
