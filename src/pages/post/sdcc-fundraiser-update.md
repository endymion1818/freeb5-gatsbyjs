Paraphrasing Mr. Bester, &#8220;&#8230;well, there&#8217;s really no delicate way to say this&#8230;I want your money.&#8221;

The #FreeBabylon5 presence at SDCC has two goals:

&#8211; Reach as many fans as possible in order to have them join us in taking action, and

&#8211; Try to get Warner Brothers&#8217; attention (they always have a big booth at Comic-Con). This is our first opportunity to reach real people with the Corporation.

To do this, we need to really present the campaign as a force to be reckoned with and to give fans something to remember us by when they get home.

There are about 130,000 attendees at SDCC and I&#8217;d consider it a success if we can reach about 5,000 of them. To that end, I&#8217;ve put together a \*very\* preliminary budget and it looks like we need about $1,500 to make these goals a reality on that kind of scale. To date we&#8217;ve been running on donations from the wonderful B5 Books Team and a few generous fans. Now I need as many as you who can spare a few bucks to PayPal them [via the Join Us][1] page or contact me at <freebabylon5@aol.com> for information on how to send a check (that&#8217;s also the PayPal email address if you want to donate directly that way.

Thank You!!
