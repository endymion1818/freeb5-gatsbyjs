It's June 1 and Amazon Prime is now carrying Babylon 5 - but apparently only in the US (with a glitch).

Non-US folks, today is the perfect day to contact Amazon in your region and *ask* for Babylon 5! It's a good bet that they're aware of what new shows have just come on in other regions so hearing from you now is perfect timing.

US folks, Today's also the perfect day to contact Amazon to thank them for B5 - and remind them that season 3 needs the switch flipped to make it included in Prime - and to ask for the movies and Crusade.
