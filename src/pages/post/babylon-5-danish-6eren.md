Ranger Jan Andersen contacted us on Facebook over the weekend to inform us of another breakthrough in the campaign!

&#8220;Babylon 5 is running on the Danish channel &#8220;6&#8217;eren&#8221; (the 6)

Monday 8:10 AM is the 1st season episode &#8220;By any Means Necessary&#8221; No info on whether they will be running the whole series or not.&#8221;

Well, Jan, we checked. And indeed, Season 1 is currently running on the channel at 07.10am every day.

Do you know any new fans who have got into the series through the 6&#8217;eren channel? If so, we&#8217;d love to hear from you!
