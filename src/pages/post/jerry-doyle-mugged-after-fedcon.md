Jerry Doyle, who played Michael Garabaldi in Babylon 5, was mugged after appearing at Fedcon Dusseldorf. There&#8217;s a [full report][1] on the website Epic Times, which was founded by Doyle.

&#8220;Jerry was attacked from behind in broad daylight, knocked unconscious, and required fourteen stitches on the back of his head. “He was robbed of everything – his wallet, his phone, his credit cards,” says Silvers. “[He] woke up some hours later in a hospital in Dusseldorf.&#8221;

We&#8217;re sorry to hear of Jerry&#8217;s misfortune.

Read the full account (and view a gruesome picture) on the [Epic Times website][1].
