Some great news! A Babylon 5 fan from the UK, Alexander Greene, has just let us know that Pick TV from Sky will be showing Babylon 5:

This is fantastic news, we think it's the first time it's available in both the UK and the US at the same time since first run.

UK-based fans: It's time to make sure everyone gets a chance at watching this great show &mdash; many for the first time!! Use the hashtag #Babylon5onPick along with #FreeBabylon5 when you talk about it.

Here's the official announcement from Pick:
