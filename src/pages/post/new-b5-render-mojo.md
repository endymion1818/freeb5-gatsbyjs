Wow wow wow! What a wonderful surprise to wake up to in the UK this morning! Adam &#8220;Mojo&#8221; Lebowitz has created this wonderful new render of the Babylon 5 stationâ€”and it&#8217;s awesome!

Here&#8217;sÂ Mojo&#8217;s post on his Facebook page:



And [here&#8217;s the link to theÂ uncompressed png graphic file.][1]

As you may have heard, Mojo hasn&#8217;t been in the best of health in recent years, and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/p8fk64hv" target="_blank">his gofundme campaign is still running</a>. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be glad of the support if you would like to donate something for his hard work on this and other renders of DS9 and Battlestar Galactica he&#8217;s published recently.

I see I&#8217;m going to have to change the home page image again ðŸ˜€
