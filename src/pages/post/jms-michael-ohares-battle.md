&#8220;This hasn&#8217;t been discussed anywhere before&#8221;.

You don&#8217;t expect those comments from a show with as big a fan base as we have. But that&#8217;s how series creator J Michael Straczynski begins this moving interview for the Archive of American Television.

The interview discusses Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s battle with schizophrenia and how Straczynski helped him and dealt with the impact on the show.

It looks like it must&#8217;ve been very difficult to discuss this sad time.
