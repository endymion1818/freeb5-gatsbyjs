This is an update on our previous post about Babylon 5 showing in the UK. Viewers Janette, Gaz and Gary have found that the series starts on Monday 13th November at 7pm UK time.

Pick did release a trailer yesterday, here it is in full glory:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Babylon 5, one of the best sci-fi series of all time (unless youâ€™re one of those people who argue for DS9) is coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pick_TV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pick_TV</a>! Start the entire series from tonight at 7pm. <a href="https://t.co/jn4C4qHkzd">pic.twitter.com/jn4C4qHkzd</a></p>&mdash; Freeview (@FreeviewTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeviewTV/status/930116606075768833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

The show is on Freeview ...if you know what channel let me know [via the freebabylon5 facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/freebabylon5) and I'll update this post.

That's about now, so go & check it out!
