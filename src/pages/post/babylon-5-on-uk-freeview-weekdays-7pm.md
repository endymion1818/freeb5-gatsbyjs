This is an update on our previous post about Babylon 5 showing in the UK. Viewers Janette, Gaz and Gary have found that the series starts on Monday 13th November at 7pm UK time.

I'm not sure how you get to see it ... I don't have a television!! However, its on Freeview ... let me know how you found it and I'll update this post.

That's about now, so go & check it out!
