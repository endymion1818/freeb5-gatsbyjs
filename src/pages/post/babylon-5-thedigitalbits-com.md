Some of you may have already seen this article on TV shows that deserve remastering for a Blu-ray release. <http://www.thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/012414_1500>

B5 is #5 on the list, saying:

&#8220;This show is a semi-forgotten gem that badly deserves new life in HD. Babylon 5 was again shot on film, and its creators even protected the image for future widescreen presentation. But while the show almost single-handedly pioneered the use of CG-based visual effects in TV (and won an Emmy for doing so), the technology used was primitive by todayâ€™s standards. Amiga-based Video Toasters anyone? If this was remastered for HD, with updated visual effects, it could be a real stunner on Blu-ray.&#8221;

How about \*all\* of us 1) PRINT this article, 2) HIGHLIGHT the parts about how stunning it would be, 3) WRITE a note explaining how B5 is \*not\* forgotten and that we fans want to help boost its popularity and 4) SEND it to this address:

Kevin Tsujihara, CEO

Warner Bros. Entertainment

4000 Warner Blvd

Burbank, CA 91505

This is the sort of thing that everybody in every country can participate in; in fact, the more the better!
