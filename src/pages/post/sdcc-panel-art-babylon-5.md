There&#8217;s even more Babylon 5 content at San Diego Comic-Con!

&#8220;The Art of Babylon 5&#8221;

Members of the iconic show&#8217;s art department, under production designer John Iacovelli, with art director Mark-Louis Walters, art director Roland Rosenkranz, graphic artist Alan Kobayashi, and concept artist and set designer Timothy Earls, reunite to discuss how they were able to design 110 episodes over five years and six TV movies while keeping the sets fresh, exciting and, well, out of this world.
