# Jumpgate Episode 100: The Gathering

OUR 100th SHOW!!! And a perfectly appropriate TV Movie to mark the event!

An aged Emperor Molari spins a tale of the Earth-Minbari War to his young wards, kept safe in the Palace during an attack on Centauri Prime. In the greatest act of fanservice ever rendered to His People, JMS fills in all the blanks you never knew were there, from young Johnny Sheridan’s rise to command, a teenage Susan Ivanova’s tearful goodbye to her doomed brother, G’Kar’s opportunism, and Delenn’s regret. The story isn’t over yet… it’s never over, this week on Jumpgate!
