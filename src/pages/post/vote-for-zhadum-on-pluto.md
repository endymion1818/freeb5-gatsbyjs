Now here&#8217;s an idea &#8211; how about we get a feature on Pluto named Z&#8217;ha&#8217;dum when the New Horizons spacecraft flies past it?? It&#8217;s already on the ballot under &#8216;Mythology and the Underworld&#8217; You can vote every day.

Let&#8217;s get people looking to the skies and wondering about this strange word gracing Pluto!
