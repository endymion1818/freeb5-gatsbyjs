Babylon 5 is now officially 25 years old. The [@b5news Twitter account](https://twitter.com/B5News) tweeted this: "Babylon 5's pilot movie, The Gathering, first aired on February 22, 1993."

In response JS tweeted the following, thanking the fans and well wishers on the occasion:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for all the good thoughts, everyone...hard to believe it&#39;s been 25 years. Very proud to have introduced the first American TV series with a five-year arc, a storytelling technique that has subsequently become an industry standard. All thanks to our amazing fans. <a href="https://t.co/x75OoWQ8AG">https://t.co/x75OoWQ8AG</a></p>&mdash; J.
