Publisher Weekly reported recently that HarperCollins’s science fiction imprint, Harper Voyager, has announced that it's first memoir is due in 2019.

The account of show creator J Michael Straczynski "chronicles his experience “growing up surrounded by poverty, violence, alcoholism and domestic abuse”".

Straczynski later tweeted out this to go along with the announcement:
