It&#8217;s official!

This was just posted by Jan moderating the FreeBabylon5 Facebook page and JMSNews concurrently: &#8220;More detail later as I listen to the recording but it&#8217;s CONFIRMED that JMS will write a BABYLON 5 feature film in 2015 for production in 2016 with or without Warner Bros&#8221;

Here&#8217;s the full post:

What does this mean? What will the material be? Will Warner finally get off their encounter-suited butts?

For me this is just great, great news and could hearken a new era of Babylon 5 goodness and fandom!
