Let&#8217;s do a BIG letter writing push this coming week! A bunch of the folks at the Space City Con last weekend wrote letters while there and I&#8217;m mailing them off. Now it&#8217;s your turn. Targets are the CEO of WB Entertainment and the Chairman of NBC Universal:

Kevin Tsujihara, CEO

Warner Bros. Entertainment

4000 Warner Blvd

Burbank, CA 91505

Bonnie Hammer, Chairman

NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group

14th Floor

100 Universal City Plaza

Please post [on our Facebook page][1] when you&#8217;ve written and mailed your letter!
