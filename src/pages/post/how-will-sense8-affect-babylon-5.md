You&#8217;ve probably heard that the [Netflix TV series Sense8][1], helmed by Babylon 5 creator Joe Michael Straczynski and Larry and Lana Wachowski, is proving to be a huge success.

If you [follow JMS on Facebook][2], he&#8217;s recently posted some stellar reviews of the series. If you haven&#8217;t checked it out yet, here&#8217;s a trailer:

If you&#8217;ve been following the campaign to #FreeBabylon5 for any length of time, you might be wondering how this affects us?

Well, the site is receiving a certain volume of traffic from people searching for Sense8 news &#8230; now we don&#8217;t want to attract people to a source that doesn&#8217;t lead them to that information &#8230; on the other hand, it does help that people who like Sense8 might be willing to check out Babylon 5 if they know that it was written and produced by JMS.

Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the Google search results:

So that&#8217;s 30 more hits than we would have seen without Sense8 around, and it&#8217;s interesting that at no.4 is people searching for &#8220;sense8 JMS&#8221;.

So if you enjoyed Sense8, it&#8217;ll be worth mentioning the link with Babylon 5 &#8230; in any case, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if Babylon 5 gets any more exposure because of this.

From a purely selfish standpoint, I hope this doesn&#8217;t make JMS too busy to write the new Babylon 5 movie in time!! &#8230; although it&#8217;s great to see JMS having success with another ground breaking scifi TV series, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree.
