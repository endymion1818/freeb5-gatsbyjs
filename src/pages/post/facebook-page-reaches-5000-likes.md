Sometime last night the [Facebook page of #FreeBabylon5][1] reached 5,000 likes! This is a fantastic milestone for a page that was created only on 2nd September last year.

Where do we go from here? Well, the campaign is growing pace with many more sites running articles about the series, and with so many fans using the hashtag #FreeBabylon5 on Facebook and Twitter. You can join them too!

And in case you didn&#8217;t already hear, Babylon 5 is back on UK TV screens via the Watch Channel. With such an important victory so early on in the campaign, we will no doubt see many more in the near future.
