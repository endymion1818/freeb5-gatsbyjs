Along with some other classic sci fi series, Comet TV in the US will shortly start showing Babylon 5:

I really like the channel's positioning as "the true home of science fiction television", and that it seems determined to reintroduce some really classic series to a new audience.

You will be able to watch Comet on TV or with their app.
