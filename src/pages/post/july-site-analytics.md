So july was a pretty good month for the campaign. Wasn&#8217;t it great to see the past years&#8217; efforts really reach a crescendo at the San Diego Comic Con, with the [announcement from JMS][1] that he&#8217;s going to write and produce a Babylon 5 movie under the banner of [Studio JMS][2]? The affect on the site&#8217;s analytics was nothing short of amazing &#8211; on that day and the two that followed we had a huge 1,246 visitors, 782 from the US, 203 from the UK, 87 from Germany, 74 from Canada, 56 from Australia and many more from Russia, Japan, Brazil and Zimbabwe and many other places. News travels fast, doesn&#8217;t it? Here&#8217;s a breakdown:

### Overall Visitors

As you can see below, we were already doing pretty well this month with a Twitter Retweet by series creator J.Michael Straczynski which garnered about 208 visits, and activity by Jan Schroeder on Facebook to promote the letter writing campaign. As July 25 came, we had more visitors than normal because of the San Diego Comic Con panel, again organised & hosted by Jan Schroeder, which led nicely into Saturday&#8217;s bombshell by JMS about the movie. That announcement brought over 569 visitors that same day and in the immediate aftermath it looks like many more people were searching the internet to find out more about the campaign. No doubt some of these are from the media community and will pick up on the story in the weeks and months to come.

### Our Audience

As you can see in this next chart below, there were a total of 2,515 users this month generating 3,156 sessions. That shows we have a good audience who keep coming back for more information &#8230; welcome and hello to you!   [<img class="alignnone wp-image-853 size-full" src="http://freeb5:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-12.29.37.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-04 at 12.29.37" width="579" height="318" />][4]   <img class="alignnone wp-image-854 size-full" src="http://freeb5:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-12.29.43.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-04 at 12.29.43" width="273" height="251" />

### Contributors Wanted!

We&#8217;re currently looking for new contributors for the Free Babylon 5 website. If you&#8217;re a regular here and are looking for a way to help the campaign more, please][5] explaining why you&#8217;d like to be a contributor and we&#8217;ll take a look at your application. We&#8217;re a little sad there has to be a vetting process at all, but we want to continue to provide a good service for fans and there are some &#8211; albeit very few &#8211; who might see an opportunity to misuse that trust.

### Visitors Flow

The chart below shows where visitors originated from and where on the site they went. Most people went to the home page to start with, then the About page, news room or another page. It&#8217;s no surprise though, that many visitors came through a social media channel and went to the article we posted about the movie announcement &#8211; which about 893 visitors alone. The red areas are people who have left the site from that page. These figures are about average in my experience and we don&#8217;t need to be concerned. However, I think we might need to take a look at the About page and see if we can get more people interested in the show from that page. Any ideas you have for this would be welcome!   <img class="alignnone wp-image-855 size-full" src="http://freeb5:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-12.30.04.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-04 at 12.30.04" width="1122" height="520" />

### Traffic Sources

How do our viewers get to the site? This chart tells us that most of you (about 826) have bookmarked the site somehow. I&#8217;m really pleased to see that the second biggest method is from a Google search. We&#8217;re currently on page 2 of Google for the search term &#8220;Babylon 5&#8221;, and the **very first result for &#8220;Free Babylon 5&#8221;**, which is an astounding achievement inside of one year and using completely voluntary means. Give yourselves a big pat on the back for that one. Our second biggest referrer is &#8220;t.co&#8221; &#8211; or Twitter with 449, then Facebook with 258 referrals. <img class="alignnone wp-image-856 size-full" src="http://freeb5:8888/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-12.31.09.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-04 at 12.31.09" width="994" height="651" />

If anyone can tell me why the weapons site ar15.com sent us 209 referrals, I would be very interested to know. Slightly puzzled by that.

### War Without End

So is this time to stop the campaign? Hang up our boots and wait for the movie? Not at all! We want to continue to support the cast and crew of Babylon 5, we want to continue to encourage people to watch the original series, and we want to see it shown on TV stations across America and the rest of the world. Hang up our boots?! Are you kidding me??
