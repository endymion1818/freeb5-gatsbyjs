Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if only we could add those together and get 100% of our SDCC fundraising goal? Well, we can&#8217;t but to update you, so far donations equal $603.18 or 40.2% and with the matching funds from &#8216;Moose&#8217;, our total so far is $904.77 or 60.3%. We can make it with \*your\* help!

So far we&#8217;ve ordered all this for the San Diego Comic-Con:

&#8211; Badge ribbons

&#8211; Give-aways for panel attendees

&#8211; Treats to give to the folks at the Warner Bros booth

&#8211; about half of the postcards we&#8217;ll need for the freebie table

I still need to get more postcards, flyers, buttons, envelopes and postage (for the panel) and maybe even another cool treat designed to get the WB booth talking about us. If you can help, I appreciate all donations large or small! Paypal to [freebabylon5@aol.com][1] Thanks!
