Somehow I missed this news, but a thread on the Babylon 5 group on Facebook referenced a tweet by JMS in January this year where he quoted a Warner Bros executive as saying &#8220;We have no plans&#8221; to do anything B5 &#8220;ever&#8221;.

Here&#8217;s that tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

    <a href="https://twitter.com/Whyrusss">@Whyrusss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/WBHomeEnt">@WBHomeEnt</a> WB TV Exec to my agent: "We have no plans to do anything with B5 in TV, new or reruns, ever." Same for other PTEN shows

This isn&#8217;t a massive surprise if you&#8217;ve been following this story for a while. It seems that there are some rights issues because of the PTEN Consortium being a shared resource for several networks, so the rights might be tied up in knots for the forseeable.

JMS still has movie rights though, so don&#8217;t give up hope yet!
