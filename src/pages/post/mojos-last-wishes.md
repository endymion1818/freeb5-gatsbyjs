**As fans who care about the show and all those who created it, when we hear that someone from the team who made the show possible is suffering, it really strikes us to the heart.**

Adam &#8220;Mojo&#8221; Leibowitz is one of those people who are going through a very rough time right now.

Mojo worked on the groundbreaking visual effects on the show, and went on to work on Battlestar Galactica. He has two Emmy awards for his work.

He says on his campaign page:

&#8220;See, as of late a bunch of wise men and women known as &#8220;doctors&#8221; have been telling me I have something &#8220;bad.&#8221; The potential diagnosis has run from bone cancer to Paget&#8217;s disease to Fibromyalgia to God-knows-what, but one thing is certain: my bones are deteriorating faster than you can say &#8220;hi Mojo here&#8217;s a dollar.&#8221;

This seems like a poor return for someone who helped create a show that continues to inspire so many of us today.

As a thank you Mojo is offering to produce some of his emma-award winning artwork:

&#8220;If you make a contribution of $100 or more I&#8217;d like to thank you by arranging to do a custom image of your favorite ship (maybe with your name/birthday on it) or if you have some dream image from Star Trek or Galactica or Babylon 5, just say the word I&#8217;m sure we can come up with something to make you happy.&#8221;

So please, no matter what you can spare, [support Mojo&#8217;s Last Wishes on gofundme.com][1]
