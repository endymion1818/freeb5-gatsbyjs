When I posted a while back, I mentioned that the #FreeBabylon5 campaign had two goals:

&#8211; to get B5 available in reruns and/or subscription streaming AND

&#8211; to keep B5 alive in people&#8217;s minds

As I&#8217;m sure most people know by now, B5 is available in the US for free streaming on the Go90 site and app. This is \*great\* news since B5 hasn&#8217;t been available in the US since it went off of Netflix in mid-2011 or in any regular reruns for over a decade.

JMS posted a link from the [Verified Babylon 5 Facebook page][1] last night and mentioned that WB seems to have noticed the attention. I think we need to **really** get their attention!

Everybody who can, would you please go to the WB page linked above and leave a message including the following:

&#8211; Thank them for making B5 available in the US after so long.

&#8211; Ask if they would please make the Movies and Crusade available as well

&#8211; Mention that fans all over the world are clamoring to see Babylon 5 streaming again and ask that they might make it available to large international streaming services.

I think we&#8217;ve got the voices to make sure they know we appreciate what&#8217;s been done and would appreciate even more. Please folks, go to the Official Babylon 5 Facebook page and post!

Thanks,

Jan
