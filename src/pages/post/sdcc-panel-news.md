The panel this morning went well, I thought. The room wasn&#8217;t quite full but I think there were probably close to 100 people. There was some good interaction and questions and at least a couple of things I need to follow up on, one of which might be really huge. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.

No, JMS didn&#8217;t make a surprise visit but a couple of the folks who&#8217;ll be involved with the Art of Babylon 5 panel came by to show support and distribute copies of the Perspective magazine with the John Iacovelli article in it to the panel attendees.

One small disappointment was that I didn&#8217;t get the volunteers I needed for the small subversiveness I&#8217;d planned for getting some attention from any WB execs at the con. I had 24 little candy jars filled with MMs that read &#8216;Free Babylon 5&#8217; and asked for volunteers to visit the WB booth at some point during the con, ask for somebody in charge and drop off the candy and one or our &#8216;Voice of the Resistance&#8217; postcards. Only about half of them were taken. I&#8217;ll manage to get them there anyhow and I just got an email from a fan willing to make multiple trips.

Spent the rest of the day at the fan table and got to talk to quite a few interested folks. Hopefully it&#8217;ll result in lots of website hits and letter writing. Oh, and I&#8217;ve learned that temporary tattoos don&#8217;t last long when you&#8217;re all sweaty. Who knew?

Looking forward to the rest of the con. I&#8217;ll report back more as things happen, but likely only once per day when I get back from the con.
