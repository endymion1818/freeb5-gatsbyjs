These are items I&#8217;ve had made up with a view to making them available to raise awareness at conventions. They&#8217;re in very limited quantities but they&#8217;re now going to be made available to fans worldwide for a donation plus postage.

For a $15 donation plus postage ($6 US and $24 International (sorry!)), you can choose any 3 items as noted in the photo description. (For example, you can get a Purple and Black badge ribbon, three small buttons and one lanyard OR a Blue key ring, five calendars and a large button OR any other combination of three items you like).

Want some of everything? You can have it all for a $30 donation plus postage (same as above).

Sorry but right now I can only do PayPal. You can use the donation button on the website or use email freebabylon5@aol.com. Be sure to send a note along as to your color choices.

Some quantities are very limited so I reserve the right to ask you to make a different choice if something runs out.
