[@babylonlurker][1] has let us know that the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention is at London this year!

Apparently &#8220;Loncon 3 will be a celebration of science fiction in all its forms. We expect well over 7,000 fans to join us at London&#8217;s ExCeL centre, along with hundreds of writers, editors, artists, and other professionals from across the genre.&#8221;

**If you&#8217;re planning to go along and would like to help distribute buttons and talk Babylon 5, look out for &#8220;Babylonlurker Jan&#8221; when you attend.**

Londoncon3&#8217;s website is <http://www.loncon3.org> and is being held Thursday 14 &#8211; Monday 18th August.

Here&#8217;s the rather fun trailer for LonCon, which features some classic scifi clips set in London:
