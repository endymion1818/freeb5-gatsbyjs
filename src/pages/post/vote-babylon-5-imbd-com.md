Ranger Jan alerted us via Facebook that there&#8217;s a poll on IMBD.com pitting TV shows featuring aliens against one another. &#8220;Which of these (live action) TV shows visited by beings from other planets is your favourite?&#8221; asks the poll.

Babylon 5 is currently creeping up on The X-Files with 54 votes to 66, and Doctor Who a close contender for third place.

Well. What are you waiting for?
