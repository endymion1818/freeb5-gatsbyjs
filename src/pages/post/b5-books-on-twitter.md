One of the main purposes of the ‪#‎FreeBabylon5‬ movement is to remind the public about Babylon 5 and keep it in the public consciousness. The folks at B5 Books ( B5Books.com ) have been doing a great job of keeping the B5 legacy alive with books of scripts, chronologies JMS posts and, most recently, a coffee table book commemorating the B5 20th anniversary and a set of books and videos spotlighting the fan experience at the Babylon 5 reunion conventions in 2013 and 2014. (Full disclosure &#8211; I sometimes consult with the B5 Books team).

Now they&#8217;ve got a brand new Twitter page and they&#8217;re starting off with an intriguing trivia question. Let&#8217;s help them keep the show alive in people&#8217;s minds.
