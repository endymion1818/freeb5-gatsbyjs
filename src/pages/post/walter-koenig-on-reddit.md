Walter Koenig, one of Babylon5&#8217;s most versatile and rounded-out villains (depending on your point of view&#8230;), recently discussed his role on the show on Reddit.

Koenig is making his last appearance as Pavel Chekov from Star Trek in the Kickstarter-funded Star Trek: Renegades, which actually looks like a great new angle on the otherwise rather 2D world of Trek.

By the way, did you see the new Star Trek trailer? What did you think?
