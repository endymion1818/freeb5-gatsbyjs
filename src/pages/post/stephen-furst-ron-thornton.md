This doesn&#8217;t get any easier. I&#8217;m coming back to this site after a hiatus (my 2nd son has just been born) to find out that two of Babylon 5&#8217;s great luminaries have passed beyond the rim.

Ron Thornton, I probably don&#8217;t need to tell you, was the mind behind Foundation Imaging, which designed and built the CGI for the first 4 seasons of the show.

Stephen Furst &#8230; ahh Vir. How we&#8217;ll miss his excellent acting, and how well he portrayed Vir Cotto. And without Ron Thornton&#8217;s ingenuity and determination, we wouldn&#8217;t have had those groundbreaking VFX which garnered so much attention for the show in the early days.

Farewell, and, thank you.
