&#8220;[the] Deal includes &#8216;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,&#8217; &#8216;Almost Human,&#8217; &#8216;Babylon 5,&#8217; &#8216;Believe,&#8217; &#8216;Stalker&#8217;

Verizon is punching the thriller and sci-fi buttons with a pact to bring all seasons of seven Warner Bros. TV shows — including “Veronica Mars” and “Fringe” — to the free Go90 mobile-video service.

The deal with Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution makes Go90 the exclusive streaming outlet for the series, which also include “Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,” “Almost Human,” “Babylon 5,” “Believe” and “Stalker.” Besides theoretically appealing to Go90’s millennial target demo, the shows were more affordable for Verizon to license than more recent TV hits. A source familiar with the pact indicated that it runs for one year or less.&#8221;

go90 is an American streaming service, launched in October 2015 by Verizon,[2] that offers a selection of TV shows, movies, clips, and other streaming media. go90 is free, ad-supported, and does not require a subscription
